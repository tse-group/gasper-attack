# A Bouncing Attack on Gasper

In our manuscript [Ebb-and-Flow] we describe a bouncing-style attack on the Gasper consensus protocol [Gasper] in a synchronous network.
This repository contains the source code for the simulation of this attack.
For a detailed description of the attack, see Section II and Appendix A of our manuscript [Ebb-and-Flow].
